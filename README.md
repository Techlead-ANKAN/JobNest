---

## 3. High‑Level Workflow

### 3.1 User Types

- **Guest** – Can see the landing page but must sign in to access jobs and posting.
- **Authenticated user (via Clerk)** – Can view jobs, save jobs, apply, and post jobs.

### 3.2 Main Flows

1. **Sign‑in / Sign‑up**
    - main.jsx wraps the app with ClerkProvider.
    - LandingPage opens a sign‑in modal automatically for unsigned users.
    - ProtectedRoute gates all protected routes (`/job`, `/postjobs`, `/savedjobs`, `/myjobs`, `/apply/:jobId`).

2. **Browsing Jobs**
    - Job page reads from the Supabase table Posted_Jobs.
    - Users can search, filter, and open a detailed job modal.

3. **Saving Jobs**
    - SaveJobBtn upserts into Saved_Jobs with a composite (UserId, JobId) constraint.
    - SavedJobs page joins Saved_Jobs with Posted_Jobs to show full job details for the current user.

4. **Applying to Jobs**
    - ApplyPage loads the job by id from Posted_Jobs.
    - User fills an application form and can attach resume/cover letter files.
    - On submit, an entry is created in Applied_Jobs for (JobId, UserId).
    - File upload is wired to the Supabase bucket applications and can be extended to persist metadata.

5. **Posting Jobs**
    - PostJobs page lets recruiters create a posting.
    - A rich‑text description is written via TinyMCE, converted to plain text, and stored in Posted_Jobs.

6. **Viewing My Activity**
    - MyJobs lists all jobs the current user has applied for, via a join on Applied_Jobs → Posted_Jobs.
    - SavedJobs lists all jobs the user has saved, via Saved_Jobs → Posted_Jobs.

Supabase Row Level Security ensures each user only sees their own rows in Applied_Jobs and Saved_Jobs, while everyone can read Posted_Jobs.

## 4. Frontend Architecture

### 4.1 Entry and Routing

- main.jsx
   - Boots React with ReactDOM.
   - Wraps the app in ClerkProvider using VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY.
   - Renders App.

- App.jsx
   - Creates the router with createBrowserRouter.
   - Defines routes:
      - `/` → LandingPage
      - `/job` → Job (protected)
      - `/postjobs` → PostJobs (protected)
      - `/savedjobs` → SavedJobs (protected)
      - `/myjobs` → MyJobs (protected)
      - `/apply/:jobId` → ApplyPage (protected)
   - Wraps everything in ThemeProvider for light/dark theme support.

- AppLayout.jsx
   - Global layout: header, footer, and a central Outlet for current page.

### 4.2 Key Pages and Features

#### LandingPage

- Shows the primary marketing hero with CTA buttons to "Find Jobs" and "Post Jobs".
- Imports static company logos from data/companiesData.json for a marquee of trusted companies.
- Renders a dynamic FAQ section from data/faq.json.
- Uses Clerk’s useUser to detect signed‑in state.
- Automatically shows a SignInModal for guests and closes it after a short delay.
- CTA buttons to `/job` and `/postjobs` are guarded: clicking them while signed out triggers the sign‑in modal instead of navigation.

#### Job (Job listing and discovery)

- Pulls job records from the Supabase table Posted_Jobs via supabase.from('Posted_Jobs').select().order('created_at', { ascending: false }).
- Client‑side filtering:
   - Free‑text search on CompanyName.
   - Filter by JobType (Full‑Time, Part‑Time, Contract, Intern).
   - Filter by LocationType (Onsite, Remote, Hybrid).
   - Text filter by Location.
- Defensive defaults: if any field is null, it substitutes human‑friendly placeholders.
- UI:
   - Animated job cards via Framer Motion.
   - "View Details" opens a full‑screen modal with complete description and meta.
   - "Apply" button navigates to `/apply/:jobId`.
- SaveJobBtn:
   - When clicked, upserts into Saved_Jobs: { UserId: current Clerk user id, JobId }.
   - Alerts on success or logs errors.

#### PostJobs (Recruiter job posting)

- Uses TinyMCE Editor for the job description.
- Collects:
   - CompanyName
   - Role
   - State + Country (combined into Location with proper casing via lodash.startCase)
   - JobType (Full‑Time, Part‑Time, Contract, Intern)
   - LocationType (Remote, Hybrid, Onsite)
   - Description (rich text converted to plain text before saving)
- On submit:
   - Parses TinyMCE HTML into plain text via DOMParser.
   - Inserts a new row into Posted_Jobs with CompanyName, Location, Role, JobType, LocationType, Description.
   - Shows a SuccessPopup and clears the form/editor.

#### SavedJobs (Saved/bookmarked jobs)

- Uses Clerk’s useUser to get the current user id.
- Fetches all saved jobs via:
   - SELECT JobId, Posted_Jobs(...) FROM Saved_Jobs WHERE UserId = current user id.
   - Maps the result to the nested Posted_Jobs rows.
- UI:
   - Card layout of each saved job with company initial, job meta, and description.
   - "View Details" opens a detailed modal similar to the Job page.
   - Trash icon (FaTrashAlt) removes a saved job by deleting from Saved_Jobs and updating local state.

#### MyJobs (Jobs the user has applied to)

- Uses useUser to get the current Clerk user.
- Queries Supabase:
   - SELECT JobId, Posted_Jobs(...) FROM Applied_Jobs WHERE UserId = current user id.
   - Maps to the nested Posted_Jobs objects.
- Displays a simple card list showing role, company, location, job type and work type, and description.

#### ApplyPage (Job application workflow)

- Grabs jobId from the URL params and fetches the matching job from Posted_Jobs.
- Renders job meta (position, company, type, location, posted date, and description) at the top.
- Application form is divided into logical sections:
   - Basic Information (name, email, phone, location, LinkedIn, portfolio)
   - Education (repeatable entries)
   - Work Experience (repeatable entries)
   - Skills
   - Documents (resume and cover letter upload widgets)
   - Preferences (location, salary, notice period, references)
- Validation:
   - Minimal validation: ensures required basic fields are filled.
- On submit:
   - Inserts into Applied_Jobs with JobId and current UserId.
   - Shows a success message and redirects back to /job after a short delay.
- File Upload:
   - handleFileUpload() is prepared to upload to the Supabase bucket applications using supabase.storage.from('applications').upload(...).
   - You can wire this into the submit handler to persist file paths into a separate table or JSON column.

### 4.3 Auth Guard (ProtectedRoute)

- ProtectedRoute uses Clerk’s useUser to check:
   - isLoaded – Clerk state loaded
   - isSignedIn – whether the user is authenticated
- If the user is not signed in once the state is loaded, it redirects to a sign‑in path.
- Otherwise it simply renders its children (the protected page components).

### 4.4 Supabase Client

- src/utils/supabase.js exposes:
   - supabase – a basic Supabase client configured with VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY.
   - supabaseClient(token) – factory that returns a client with Authorization: Bearer <Clerk JWT>, for RLS‑protected queries when using Clerk JWTs.

---

## 5. Data Model and Backend Workflow

The complete SQL for the backend lives in COMPLETE_SUPABASE_SETUP.sql. At a high level:

### 5.1 Core Tables

- Posted_Jobs
   - Stores public job postings (company, role, location, job type, work mode, description, timestamps).
- Applied_Jobs
   - Tracks applications for a job.
   - Fields: id, JobId (FK → Posted_Jobs), UserId (Clerk user id), applied_at.
   - Unique constraint on (JobId, UserId) to prevent duplicate applications.
- Saved_Jobs
   - Stores bookmarked jobs for each user.
   - Fields: id, JobId (FK → Posted_Jobs), UserId, saved_at.
   - Unique constraint on (JobId, UserId) to prevent duplicate saves.
- Storage bucket: applications
   - Private bucket for storing resumes and cover letters.

### 5.2 Row Level Security (RLS)

- Posted_Jobs
   - SELECT: open (anyone can read jobs).
   - INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE: allowed only for authenticated users.
- Applied_Jobs
   - SELECT: user can only see rows where UserId = auth.jwt() →> 'sub'.
   - INSERT/DELETE: user can create and delete their own application rows.
- Saved_Jobs
   - SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE are restricted to rows where UserId matches the JWT subject.
- Storage (applications bucket)
   - Users can only access files they uploaded (folder prefix or metadata checks).

ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md contains detailed ASCII diagrams of these relationships and flows.
